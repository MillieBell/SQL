--Customer & order analysis project
--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

--How many many unique orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(distinct orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT (distinct orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE JanSales.Product = 'iPhone'
AND length (orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

--What are the customer account numbers for all the orders placed in February?
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length (orderid)= 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product
, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
;

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT sum(Quantity)
, Product
, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product
;

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(customers.acctnum)
, AVG(Quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

--Find all orderIDs in the MarSales table where the orderID has the characters '16' in the beginning, followed by one unknown character, then a ‘0’, and any number of characters for the rest
SELECT OrderID
