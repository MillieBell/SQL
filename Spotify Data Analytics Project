For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle, created a table to insert the data into and performed SQL analysis on the data

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

I inserted a .csv file containing the Spotify data into the file, then explored the data to answer the following questions: 

--What is the average danceability by artist and track?
SELECT artist_name
, track_name
, avg(danceability) as avg_danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

--Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT artist_name, 
popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

--What artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name
, track_name
, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1
;

--What is the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT artist_name
, track_name
, popularity
, avg(danceability) as avg_danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10
;
